## FAQs that no one asked
**Q: What is this?**  
A: This is a thing you can use to read RAIN with an actual reader that doesn't suck! 

**Q: Why did you make this?**  
A: At the time of this commit being made, I am doing my first readthrough and dislike all the official reading sites. I like the Cubari reader quite a bit, so I figured I might as well port RAIN to that.

**Q: How does this work?**  
A: ~~It doesn't.~~ Basically, I copy down all the direct image links to RAIN from the [official site](https://rain.thecomicseries.com) using a script, put them into that RAIN.json file you see in the filelist, and from there Cubari does the rest!

**Q: What is the difference between this and the official versions?**  
A: If I did everything correctly, nothing. In practice I will probably miss a page somewhere. As far as I know this does not give or take revenue away from Jocelyn. 

**Q: Should I use this?**  
A: If you want. It's ultimately a preference thing. 

**Q: How can I support RAIN?**  
A: Go give Jocelyn your money via her [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/RainComic), [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/littlelynn84/shop/), or [buy the official novels](https://www.lulu.com/spotlight/LittleLynn84).

**Q: How can I support you?**  
A: I don't want your money. I will take your cat photos though. 

**Q: I found an issue!**  
A: Oh no! Please report it using the "Issues" tab up above. You will need a GitHub account. I will get to it as soon as possible.
